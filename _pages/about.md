<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hey, thanks for dropping by! I'm a Data Scientist/Engineer living in gorgeous New Zealand who loves to code, write and learn. I aim to write about tech, data science, culture and reflections on my life and work. This blog is intended as a [digital garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up) and platform to practice something I want to get better at -- writing. 

Happy browsing! ðŸ’»
