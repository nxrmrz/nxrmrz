My first technical Medium article has been published!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ 

[Linked here](https://medium.com/chnnl/deploying-an-externally-trained-deep-learning-model-for-batch-inference-in-aws-2d0b21a0b7cd), It's about deploying a transformer natural language processing model I've built for a start-up I've worked for in the past called [chnnl](https://www.chnnl.app/). This open source model (BERT) is written in PyTorch and deployed onto an AWS Managed Container for batch inference. The model reads text and outputs an emotion and sentiment label. I thought I'd write about it as documentation on this topic is very sparse at this time from AWS' side.
